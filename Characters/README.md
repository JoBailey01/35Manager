The .ddc file extension, short for 'D&D Character', is used for all character sheet input to 35Manager.
Any file that does not have the .ddc extension (and is not a special .txt file) but is in a group folder will be ignored by the programme.

Any folder that has a name starting with "_" will be ignored by the group-reading process.

By default, groups have the same name as their folder.
If a 'name.txt' file is present, the first line of that file replaces the default name as the group's name. All subsequent lines are alternate group names (i.e., aliases).
A 'notes.txt' file in a group is used to record random notes for the group.
