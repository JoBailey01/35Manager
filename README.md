This project functions as a session manager for D&D 3.5e. It allows DMs to keep records of skill check roll times, to log key events in a central location, to import PC and NPC statblocks through formatted text files, and, most importantly, to make full-party skill checks.

The Characters directory stores parties of characters. See the applicable README for further details.

After running 35Manager, type any single letter to see the available commands.
